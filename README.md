# @lsp-mux/vscode-eslint-lsp

ESLint language server extracted from the
[VS Code ESLint extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint).

## Why?

The commonly used [`vscode-langservers-extracted`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted)
package (v4.10.0) bundles an ESLint server that doesn't support ESLint 10's
flat config — it crashes on `eslintConfig.plugins` iteration. The Zed fork
(`@zed-industries/vscode-langservers-extracted`) intentionally
[removed ESLint](https://github.com/zed-industries/vscode-langservers-extracted/commit/d93b048).

This package bundles the pre-built `eslintServer.js` from the official
VS Code ESLint extension VSIX, supporting ESLint 6–10 including flat config.

## Usage

```sh
npm install @lsp-mux/vscode-eslint-lsp
node ./node_modules/@lsp-mux/vscode-eslint-lsp --stdio
```
